<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<p>
This is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 
</p>

<h3>Students</h3>
<p>
This is a console application that uses the "Entity Framework" for the insertion of students in a database, based in the "Code-First Convention".
